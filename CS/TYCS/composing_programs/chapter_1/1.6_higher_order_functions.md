# 1.6 Higher-order functions

Functions are a method of abstraction that describe compound operations. By defining a `square` function we are not talking about the square of a particular number but defining the concept of squaring:

```python
def square(x):
    return x * x
```
Any powerful programming language should provide means of abstraction by assigning names to common paterns. Without those means we would be stuck using the primitives of the language:

```python
>>> 3 * 3
9

>>> 5 * 5
25
```
