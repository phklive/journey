# 1.4 Designing functions

Functions are essential to programs, they are our primary medium to express computational processes in programs. What makes a good function?:

1. **Each function should have exactly one job**, identifiable with a short name.
2. **Don't repeat yourself**, logic should be defined once, given a name and be re-used multiple times.
3. **Functions should be defined generally**, Squaring is not in the Python lib, because it's a special case of `pow`.
