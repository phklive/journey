# 1.3 Defining new functions

We will now learn about `function definition` a more powerful means of abstraction by which a name can be bound to a compound operation, which can be referred to as a unit.

```python
def square(x):
    return mul(x, x)
```

This new function is not built in the interpreter. It represents the compound operation of multiplying a number by itself. Here `def` is the definition that creates this user-defined function and binds it with the name `square`.

Functions can be defined as follows:

```
def <name>(<formal parameters>):
    return <return expression>
```

We can also use a function as a building block to define other functions:

```python
def sum_square(x, y):
    return add(square(x), square(y))
```

One cannot deferientiate user-defined functions from built-in functions.
