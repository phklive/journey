# 1.2 Elements of programming

A programming language is more than just a means to instruct a computer to perform tasks. It's a framework to organize our ideas about computation. Programs are meant to be shared and hence read, first by people and then by machines.

Every powerful language has three ways to combine simple ideas to form more complex ideas:

1. **Primitive expressions and statements**, which represents the simplest building block of the language.
2. **Means of combination**, by which compound elements are built from simpler ones.
3. **Means of abstraction**, by which compound elements can be named and manipulated as units.

In programming there are 2 kinds of elements: functions and data. Data is stuff we want to manipulate and functions describe rules to manipulate this data.

## 1.2.1 Expressions

The most primitive expression in Python is a number:

```python
>>> 42
42
```

Expressions representing numbers can be combined with mathematical operators (+, -, *, /) to form compound expressions:

```python
>>> -1 - -1
0

>>> 10 + 12
22
```

Mathematical expressions in Python use the `infix` notation (operator in between of operands).

## 1.2.2 Call expressions

The most important compound expression is a `call expression`, which applies a function to some arguments.

```python
>>> max(7.5, 9.5)
9.5
```

This call expression is compound expression formed of sub-expressions:

```python
  max        (   7.5   ,   9.5   )
--------       -------   -------
Operator       Operand   Operand
```

The `Operator` specifies a function where `7.5` and `9.5` are `Operands` and where `9.5` is the return value.

The order of the arguments in a call expression matters, for instance `pow` raises the first argument to the power of the second argument:

```python
>>> pow(2, 10)
1024
```

Function notation has 3 advantages over mathematical convention of infix notation:

1. Functions may take an arbitrary number of elements.
2. No ambiguity can arise, the function name always precedes it's arguments.
3. Notation can be simplified using function names instead of symbols (hard to type).


## 1.2.3 Importing library functions

Python defines a large number of functions, but does not make all of them available by default. Instead it organizes them into modules. To use these elements a developer `imports` them. The `math` module provides a variety of familiar mathematical functions:

```python
>>> from math import sqrt
>>> sqrt(256)
16.0
```

In Python the way of importing a function from a module is the following: 

```
from <module> import <function_1>, <function_2>, <function_n>
```

Documentation lists functions defined by each module.


## 1.2.4 Names and the Environment

The simplest means of abstraction is to bind names to values. It can be done in Python using the `=` symbol. Biding a name from it's left to a value on it's right.

```python
>>> radius = 10
>>> radius
10
```

The possibility of binding names to values and retrieving them implies that the interpreter keeps some sort of memory. Which in Python is called the `Environment`. Names can also be bound to functions, for instance `max` is a name bound to the function that we have been using.

## 1.2.5 Evaluating nested expressions

In evaluating nested expressions the interpreter is itself following a procedure.

> To evaluate a call expression, Python will do the following:
>
>Evaluate the operator and operand subexpressions, then
>Apply the function that is the value of the operator subexpression to the arguments that are the values of the operand subexpressions.

This implies that in the process of evaluating a call expression we must first evaluate other expressions, which implies that the evaluation procedure is recursive in nature; that is, it includes as one of it's steps, the need to invoke itself.

For example, evaluating `>>> sub(pow(2, add(1, 10)), pow(2, ))` results in the following `expression tree`:

## 1.2.6 The non-pure print function

We can distinguish between two types of functions:

1. **Pure functions**. Functions have some input (arguments) and return some output (result of applying to them):

For instance the `abs` function:

```python
>>> abs(-2)
2
```

Can be depicted as a small machine that takes input and produces output.

![abs small machine](../assets/chapter_1/function_abs.png)

The function `abs` is `pure`. Pure functions have the property that applying them has no other effect than returning a value. Moreover, a pure function must always return the same value when called twice with the same arguments.

2. **Non-pure functions**. In addition to returning a value, applying a `non-pure` can have side effects, which make some change to the state of the interpreter or computer.


For instance the `print` function:

```python
>>> print(1, 2, 3)
1 2 3
```

Can be depicted as follows:

![print small machine](../assets/chapter_1/function_print.png)

While `abs` and `print` may appear similar they work in fundamentally different ways. The value that `print` returns is always `None`, a special Python value that represents `nothing`. The Python interpreter does not print the value `None` it prints output as a side effect of being called.
