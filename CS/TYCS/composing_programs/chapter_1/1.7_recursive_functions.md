# 1.7 Recursive functions

A function is called `recursive` if the body of the function calls the function itself, either directly or indirectly.

```python
def sum_digits(n):
    """Return the sum of the digits of a positive integer n."""
    if n < 10:
        return n
    else:
        all_but_last, last = n // 10, n % 10
        return sum_digits(all_but_last) + last
```

The common pattern of recursive functions starts with a `base` case. A conditional statement that defines the behavior of the function for the inputs that are simplest to process. There can be multiple base cases. In the case of `sum_digits` the base case is any single digit input simply gets returned. Recursive functions express computation by breaking down problems into smaller problems. Simplifying them incrementally.
