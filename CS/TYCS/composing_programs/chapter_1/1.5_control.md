# 1.5 Control

The power of our functions is limited for now considering that we have not learnt about `Control statements`. They are statements that control the flow of a program's execution based on the results of logical comparisons.

## 1.5.1 Statements

## 1.5.2 Compound statements

## 1.5.2 Defining functions II: Local assignment

## 1.5.4 Conditional statements

In Python the `abs` function returns the absolute value of a given number. As of now we do not have the tools to define such a function considering that we have no way to express a comparison and a choice, it can be done as follows:

```Python
def absolute_value(x):
    """Returns the absolute value of x."""
    if x > 0:
        return x
    elif x == 0:
        return 0
    else:
        return -x

result = absolute_value(-2)
```

## 1.5.6 Testing

Testing a function is the act of verifying that the function's behavior matches expectations.
