# 2.2 Data abstraction

Most things that we would like to represent have a compound structure. For example coordinates have a longitude and a latitude. We want our programming language to enable us to couple them together into a `compund data` value that our program can manipulate as a single conceptual unit, but where each part can also be considered individually.

The concept of `data abstraction` analogous to `functional abstraction` enables to hide the implementation details of the compound data value, enabling our programe to manipulate higher level objects.
