# 2.3 Sequences

A sequence is an ordered collection of values. It is not a particular instance of a type but a collection of behaviors shared among multiple types (e.g., lists, tuples, strings, etc.). They have a `length` and the ability to do `element selection`.

## 2.3.3 Sequence processing

```python
# The general form of a list comprehension is the following:
# [<map expression> for <name> in <sequence expression> if <filter expression>]

# Example
list = [1,2,3,4,5]
doubled = [x * 2 for x in list]
even_squared = [x * x for x in list if x % 2 == 0]
odd_squared = [x * x for x in list if not x % 2 == 0]

print(list, doubled, even_squared, odd_squared)
```
