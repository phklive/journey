# 2.1 Building abstractions with data

This chapter focuses on data, how to represent and manipulate information.

## 2.1.1 Native data types

Every value in Python has a `class` that determines which type of value it is.

One can check the type of a value using:

```python
>>> type(1)
<class 'int'>
```

This will return the `class` of the object which is an instance of the `class`.

Python includes three native data types: integers (int), real numbers (float) and complex numbers (complex).

> **Warning**
> Floats are not exact but are approximated hence with a limited amount of precision that could potentially lead to errors, this should be kept in mind.
